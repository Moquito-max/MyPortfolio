            <p>Hello! I'm a Computer Engineer student at UNAM. I enjoy coding, and facing challenges. Welcome to my portfolio!</p>

                <h3>NTN</h3>
                
                <p>Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) are networks or segments of networks that use either Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) operating typically between 8 and 50km altitudes, including High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) or satellites in different constellations to carry a transmission equipment relay node or a base station:</li>
                <li>LEO (Low Earth Orbit): Circular orbit in altitudes of typ. 500-2.000km (lower delay and better link budget but larger number of satellites needed for coverage)</li>
                <li>MEO (Medium Earth Orbit): Circular orbit in altitudes of typ. 8.000-20.000km</li>
                <li>GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit): Circular orbit 35.786 km above the Earth's equator (Note: Due to gravitational forces a GEO satellite is still moving within a range of a few km around its nominal orbital position).</li>
                <li>HEO (Highly Elliptical Orbiting): Elliptical orbit around the earth</p>

                <h3>6G</h3>
                <p>The vision for 6G is built on the desire to create a seamless reality where the digital and physical worlds as we know them today have merged. This merged reality of the future will provide new ways of meeting and interacting with other people, new possibilities to work from anywhere and new ways to experience faraway places and cultures.</p>
                <p>Examples of important 6G use cases include e-health for all, precision health care, smart agriculture, earth monitor, digital twins, cobots and robot navigation. These use cases can be sorted into three broad use case scenarios: the Internet of Senses, connected intelligent machines, and a connected sustainable world.</p>
